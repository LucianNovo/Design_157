                        I agree with the author when he says that complexity should only come from a library of simple tools. I also see how simple photoshop can be when taken as a set of individually simple tools. Where I find there to be a lack of understanding from the author is in the use of metalworking tools and photoshop to make a series of modifications. Sure photoshop is simple if you can press a button and apply a filter. But to me, the analogy breaks when you crop, contrast, position, scale etc- within the various tool dialogues of a multimedia tool. The same goes for metalworking. It isn’t as if there’s a linear process for making a silver spoon.

                      In the creative world, there’s a dialogue between tools. You go from one to another, and from another to one. Your product may be simple, but your process certainly won’t be. If we’re considering the complexity of interfaces for creative work, it’s clear to see that this dialogue requires experience with each tool. We can say that a complex (photo/metal)shop is only a collection of simple tools, but it’s more of a complex space for compounding simple elements and processes.

                         My favorite interface is the commit app by Nathan Barry. The designer addressed the complex mission of the app tersely, which ultimately lead to it's distinguished popularity. The idea of the app is to track your commitments, and to reward yourself for staying devoted. Such an tracking system could require any array of checkin functionality and gamification aspects- but Commit delivers the the mojo of this topic with three simple functions. 1. Users can create a commitment 2. Users can indicate that they've completed their commitment for the day and 3. Users can see how many days in a row they've completed their commitments.

                       My interface relates to a popular cross-generational game, Pokemon. I sought to emulate the style to create a nostalgia and reminisce happy memories with the user. BY referencing this childhood object object I was sure to reinvoke happiness without instating something new. 

                        The easiest way to create understanding embody something the user already empathizes with. Many of the other 'Pocket' assignments came with well known phrases like 'Don't leave the house without it' or 'Smooth lips in a stick', this make the interpretation of the language easy- my use of a toy makes the interaction this informal and personal. From prior experience the user knows what buttons to symbolize what- and will work through the interface to reminisce the their experiences.
